🚀 Learning-DSA: Mastering Data Structures and Algorithms and GIT 

Welcome to my personal learning journal and resource repository dedicated to mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

This repository serves as a systematic approach to strengthening core problem-solving skills, implementing foundational data structures from scratch, and solving high-quality problems from platforms like LeetCode and GeeksForGeeks.

All solutions are currently implemented in C and C++.

🛠️ How to View and Run Code

Clone the Repository:

git clone [https://github.com/gavy0037/Learning-DSA.git](https://github.com/gavy0037/Learning-DSA.git)



Navigate to a Topic:

cd Learning-DSA/02_Linked_Lists



Compile the C/C++ file (using gcc or g++):

# For C:
gcc linked_list_reverse.c -o reverse
./reverse

# For C++:
g++ solution_file.cpp -o solution
./solution
