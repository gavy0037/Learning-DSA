Learning-DSA

Mastering Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) with C/C++

🚀 About

Welcome to Learning-DSA — my personal learning journal and resource repository dedicated to building problem-solving skills from the ground up.
I’m implementing core data structures from scratch and solving quality algorithmic problems (e.g., from LeetCode, GeeksForGeeks) to strengthen both conceptual understanding and coding fluency.

📂 Repository Structure & Progress

This repo is organized by topic, making navigation easy and tracking progress transparent.

1. Fundamentals — Time/Space Complexity, Recursion, Bit Manipulation (✅ Complete)


2. Linear Structures — Arrays, Strings (🔄 In Progress)


3. Linked Lists — Singly, Doubly, Circular (🔄 In Progress)


4. Dynamic Programming (DP) — Overlapping Subproblems, Memoization/Tabulation (🔄 In Progress)



Folder Structure

/01_Fundamentals
/02_Arrays_Strings
/03_Linked_Lists
/04_Dynamic_Programming
/LeetCode_Solutions

Each folder contains implementations (in C/C++) of the key topics and solved problems.

🧑‍💻 How to Use

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/gavy0037/Learning-DSA.git

Navigate to a topic folder:
cd Learning-DSA/02_Arrays_Strings

Compile and run solutions:
For C:
gcc solution_file.c -o solution
./solution

For C++:
g++ solution_file.cpp -o solution
./solution

📝 Why This Repository

Structured roadmap to cover DSA topics methodically

Hands-on implementation in C and C++ — reinforcing both memory fundamentals and performance

Regular updates with new problems and solutions as I learn
